Overview
========

The `Syncurity IR-Flow <https://www.syncurity.net>`_  DXL Python client library provides a high level wrapper for the Syncurity IR-Flow
DXL fabric API.

The purpose of this service is to allow users to perform IR-Flow API commands via the DXL fabric, without having to focus on the IR-Flow and DXL fabric syntax.

The irflowclient.client.IRFlowApiClient class wraps the connection to the DXL fabric and is use to execute IR-Flow API actions.
